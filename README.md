# Stockmarket_Database
Code from final project of WWU Databases (CSCI 330) class

This program performs data mining by querying a database (on professor's server) full of stockmarket
data, sorting through to work with only relevant data, performing calculations on that data, and 
then writing that manipulated/relevant data to a new database.
